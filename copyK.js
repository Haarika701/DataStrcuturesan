// Given a linked list, make a copy of the list from the kth position (from the head) to the end of the list.
// * You may assume all elements have positive integer value, and k is positive.
// * k position/index follows the one-based numbering rule (i.e. the position/index of the first element of an array is 1, not 0).
// * If k exceeds the length of the list, return a linked list node with a value -1 instead.
