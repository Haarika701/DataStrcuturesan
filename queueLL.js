‚ùì PROMPT
Implement a basic queue class using a linked list as the underlying storage. Queues have two critical methods, enqueue() and dequeue() to add and remove an item from the queue, respectively. You'll also need a constructor for your class, and for convenience, add a size() method that returns the current size of the queue. All of these methods should run in O(1) time!

Remember, a queue is a first-in, first-out (or last-in, last-out) data structure!

A doubly linked list is one of the simplest ways to implement a queue. You'll need both a head and tail pointer to keep track of where to add and where to remove data. Using a doubly linked list means you can do both operations without walking the whole list and all modifications of the list are at the ends.

Example(s)
q = new LLQueue();
console.log(q.size()) // 0
q.enqueue(2);
q.enqueue(3);
console.log(q.size()) // 2
console.log(q.dequeue()); // 2
console.log(q.size()) // 1
console.log(q.dequeue()); // 3
