❓ PROMPT
Fold the right side of the binary tree onto the left side of the tree as if it was on a piece of paper with the root at the center of the vertical axis. Combine the values when they overlap.

**Hint**: Start out by solving complete trees, then move on to symmetric trees, and finally explore asymmetric trees. Use helper functions to do some of the steps.
