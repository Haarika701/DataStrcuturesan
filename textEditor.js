‚ùì PROMPT
Write a function to simulate the undo operation in a text editor and outputs the final text after applying all of the commands. The editor supports the following three commands:

"append <char>": Append the character <char> to the end.

"backspace": Delete the last character.

"undo": Undo the most recent change to the document.

The "undo" command should revert the most recent change made to the text. Meaning if the most recent command was "append", it should remove that character. If the subsequent command was "backspace", it should add the character back in.

Example(s)
commands = ["append a", "append b", "backspace", "append c", "undo", "append d", "undo", "append e"]

Output: "ae"

Explanation:
* append a: appends "a"
* append b: appends "b"
* backspace: removes "b"
* append c: appends "c"
* undo: removes "c"
* append d: appends "d"
* undo: removes "d"
* append e: appends "e"
 

üîé EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
 
append => push 
backspace => pop
undo => keep track of the word that was entrered in the text 
and pop if its already tracked
Insightful & revealing test cases:
 if no cmd given, then return empty
and no number of undos will return an error as many undos as the function maybe till the string is empty


üß† BRAINSTORM
What approaches could work?
Algorithm 1:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
 operations are performed on each chara of a string and hence o(n)


üìÜ PLAN
Outline of algorithm #: 
 Iterate through the list of commands and for each action 'backspace', 'undo', 'append' do some actions.
'backspace' Remove last character from the text, and store action and character in a 'history'
'undo' get the most recent action and char from 'history' and determine what to do between append and backspace
'append' add the char to 'test' and store action to 'history'


üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENT
function simulateEditor(commands) {
def simulateEditor(commands: list[str]) -> str:
 

üß™ VERIFY
Run tests. Methodically debug & analyze issues.
